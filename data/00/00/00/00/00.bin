  |                                                                         |
  |   How Will You Survive?                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer.         |
  |   Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either             |
  |   stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or    |
  |   bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk    |
  |   and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason!      |
  |   Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you     |
  |   want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe      |
  |   you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape        |
  |   while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless          |
  |   opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a            |
  |   consequence.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Friday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change,    |
  |   giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for     |
  |   his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable,          |
  |   forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long   |
  |   night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is   |
  |   going to strike!                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Play as the Counselors!                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the      |
  |   game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths    |
  |   and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain      |
  |   situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or    |
  |   come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will    |
  |   have the chance to continually update and improve their characters    |
  |   through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play,    |
  |   the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!          |
  |                                                                         |
